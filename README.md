# selenium-projects
My Selenium projects from my former school.



## How to run the files?

1. Run IntelliJ and click on open project. 
2. Browse to the directory where the project file is located.
3. Select the root(repository) folder! (EU5TestNGSelenium)
4. When the file has loaded up in IntelliJ, follow these steps while exanding the folders
        EU5TestNGSelenium -> src -> test -> java -> com -> cybertek -> tests
      
5. Now you can click on any project and it will load into IntelliJ!

PS. Don't forget to click "Trust project".
